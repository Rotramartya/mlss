Programming Assignment 1
------------------------

We continue with the SPAM dataset that we used while practising classification using k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees in Lecture 2. This dataset comprises of email feature vectors, where each email is represented by a 57 dimensional feature vector. The training set comprises of 3680 emails and the test set has the remaining 921 emails. Here, we would implement a linear classification model to try and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

You have to implement a logistic regression model for this purpose. It would be preferred if you use Python for the same, although other convenient languages like Octave can also be used. If you implement the model from scratch (with or without the skeleton code provided in this example), you will get more credit than if you were to use a library that already has logistic regression implemented (like sklearn). Very few marks are awarded for accuracy, so don't worry if your model doesn't perform very well. Just make sure that it is correct and not very inefficient.
